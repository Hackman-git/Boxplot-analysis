# Boxplot-analysis
Use in the NormalSample.csv to generate box-plots for answering the following questions.

a)	(5 points) What is the five-number summary of x?  What are the values of the 1.5 IQR whiskers?

b)	(5 points) What is the five-number summary of x for each category of the group? What are the values of the 1.5 IQR whiskers for each category of the group?

c)	(5 points) Draw a boxplot of x (without the group) using the Python boxplot function.  Can you tell if the Pythonâ€™s boxplot has displayed the 1.5 IQR whiskers correctly?

d)	(5 points) Draw a graph where it contains the boxplot of x, the boxplot of x for each category of Group (i.e., three boxplots within the same graph frame).  Use the 1.5 IQR whiskers, identify the outliers of x, if any, for the entire data and for each category of the group.
Hint: Consider using the CONCAT function in the PANDA module to append observations.
